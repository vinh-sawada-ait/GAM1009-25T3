# Week 5
- TOPIC: Spawning Enemies and Collision Detection
- CONCEPT: Spawning and Destroying Actors/Objects
- TERMINOLOGY: collision, object type, trace type, overlap, block, query, timer
- SKILL: Configure custom collision, create custom functions

# Agenda
- Create enemy that flies straight and shoots
- Create a system that spawns the enemy
- Configure collision in the project and on the actor classes so that enemies detect when shot.

Assignment 1

Activity 3
Endless enemy spawning

Need an enemy
	Collision
	Geometry
	Material
	Shooting mechanic
	Movement

Need a spawner (BP_EnemySpawner)
	What? enemy to spawn
	Where? Location to spawn
		Let's pick a random Y value that can be used to position the enemy, just off screen.
	When? time at which to spawn

We have created a BP_Enemy_A
We created a child of BP_Bullet_2D
	Called it BP_Bullet_2D_Player
	Made it blue, using a material instance
