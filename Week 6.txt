# Enemy Health System
 - What are we building?
	Enemy overlaps player's bullet (has a fixed damage, stored as a float) and causes enemy to lose health, until 0, when it dies.
	a float variable which represents the enemy's health
	start with a float variable "max health"
	Visual effects
	Audio effects
 - Draw a diagram of our existing enemy system (including spawning, shooting, collision detection and death)
 - Add new parts to the diagram for a health system


Float vs integer?

Integers
faster to calculate
don't need to round them off, to present on the UI
bullets do 10dmg
health at 100hp

if you have a pickup...
That adds dmg.
bullets 100+20 = 120
adds by %
bullets 100*1.2 = 120

Health bar
|=========-|

Where should be create the blueprint script?
Where could it go?
	-Enemy <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< Event occurs
	-Player Fire (Bullet) <<< Event occurs
	-Player
	-Game State
	-Enemy spawner

Break until 2:15

If you destroy an actor...your ability to reference it, or reference its components, or its variables...is lost.

We need to ensure that the damage amount is communicated to the enemy BP before the bullet is destroyed.


Break until 3:10
