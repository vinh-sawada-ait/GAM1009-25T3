====
General approach to programming should always include planning phase

What are we building?
Define it, it simple terms
Flying object that moves in 2D (left/right/forward/backwards)
When a player provides associated input that defines (left/right/forward/backwards)
collision? Bounds of screen?

Determine core features
Object (geometry, model, 2D sprite)
movement
player inputs
2D

Identify the separate parts

Draw a diagram

Break 2:10

Create BP_PlayerPawn
	Adding components
	component settings (detail panel)

inputIsForward		Boolean
inputIsBackward		Boolean
inputIsRight		Boolean
inputIsLeft		Boolean

MovingForwardBackward	Float (-1 to 1)

InputMove		2D vector

Break until 3:05
